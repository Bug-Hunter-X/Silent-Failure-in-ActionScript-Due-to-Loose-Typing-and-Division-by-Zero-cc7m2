# Silent Failure in ActionScript Due to Loose Typing and Division by Zero

This example demonstrates a potential issue in ActionScript related to loose typing and error handling.  Specifically, it focuses on how division by zero can lead to unexpected results without explicit error handling. While a simple `if` statement handles the case, this approach might be insufficient in complex scenarios. More robust error handling should be considered for production applications.

## Bug
The `complexCalculation` function attempts to handle division by zero by returning 0 when `value2` is 0. However, this approach can be problematic because it masks the error condition. A more robust method would be to throw an exception or use a more sophisticated error-handling mechanism.

## Solution
The provided solution shows how to replace the default return value with an exception to clearly signal error conditions, allowing for better debugging and application stability.  Error handling prevents unexpected behavior and ensures application integrity.
